> Privacy is a fundamental right that is being threatened by the digital age. In this post, I will share with you what I learn after X was banned in Brazil and what you should do in these cases.

Topic to be covered in this article:

1. Why you should care about your privacy on-line.
2. The basics: passwords and password managers.
3. You should buy a VPN;
4. Where should you search? Search engines.
5. Navigate safely with good browsers.
6. Private e-mails.
7. Talk safely with your friends.
8. Social media: why am I using Nostr.

## 1. Why you should care about your privacy on-line.

Nowadays everything is so comfortable: you have all your files in a cloud and you can access everything with your phone or with your browser.
You have all your friends in the palm of your hands. You have access to all the knowledge of the entire history of humanity in seconds.

But with all this comfort come also a very threatener fact: your privacy is in danger!

> "Why should I care?"

Maybe you are so dopped with all these good things that you simply never stopped to think about.

I really do not think we are close to 1984, a dystopic world written by George Orwell. But I will cite some facts to make you think:

1. Google has access to all your e-mail contents, to sell you ads.
2. Microsoft will take screenshots while you are using your PC.
3. Meta knows more about you than (probably) your own partner.
4. All your photos maybe are at Google servers, so they know the face of everyone you know.
5. If your data are leaked from some service, you can be phished by a bad person.
6. Are all your passwords the same? Probably some of your accounts are already opened by someone you don't know.

So, if you are a common user of the internet, maybe you do not need all that I will show you. But if you have at least one important account,
like internet banking, confidential data or just don't want that another one sees what you are storing or searching, I will strongly sugest you to keep reading.


## 2. The basics: passwords and password managers.

The most trivial thing you should be caring about is your passwords.
